Hi, I would like to have your help on restructuring the attached file. It's a Markdown document that is used as a prompt for AI agents. It grew over the last few weeks and is a bit of a mess. Can you please thoroughly analyze this document? And restructure it without losing any information. Please double- and triple-check that no information is lost before you write it out. Also, additionally, if you find parts that are easy to misunderstand, please tell me about it in an extra output, apart from the document to be created. I will then go through each of your comments and will think about a possible fix. You may also propose a better text if you can. Please remember, this document is addressed to an AI LLM. Please create a structure that is perfect for the AI and good for me as a human to extend and change.

Please, structure the content into sections:
1. Core Identity and Protocol
2. Strict Coding Style Guidelines
3. Project Context: WebAssistantForensics
4. Frontend Development: Favorites Sidebar
5. Current Development Roadmap
6. Next-Level Vision: Subsection Favorites & Live Previews
The order should be from general/strategic to topic-based/tactical and specific/operational.
